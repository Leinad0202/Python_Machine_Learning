Python Machine Learning
Description
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project that analyzes client data to build and evaluate predictive models. It includes a Jupyter notebook (main.ipynb) alongside two data files (clientes.csv and novos_clientes.csv)
github.com
. The notebook loads and preprocesses the client dataset, trains machine learning models (such as decision trees and random forests), and makes predictions on new client data. The focus is on demonstrating the end-to-end workflow of data import, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
How to Run
Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed. Install required libraries using pip, for example: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
github.com
. (If visualizations are included, also install libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib.)
Launch the notebook: Open the main.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab within the project directory.
Execute cells: Run the notebook cells sequentially. This will load the CSV data, perform preprocessing (e.g., encoding categorical features and scaling), train the models, and output evaluation results.
Review results: Check the console output or plots generated by the notebook to see model performance metrics and any saved predictions on novos_clientes.csv.
Features
Data Loading and Cleaning: Imports client data from CSV files and handles missing or inconsistent values.
Categorical Encoding: Uses label encoding or one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables (such as profession or credit mix) into numerical format.
Feature Selection & Scaling: Selects relevant features for the model and applies standardization/normalization as needed.
Model Training: Trains multiple machine learning classifiers (e.g. decision tree, random forest, or KNN) to predict client outcomes.
Evaluation Metrics: Computes and compares accuracy and other performance metrics for each model.
Results Presentation: Summarizes findings in tables or plots and clearly presents model comparison results

Technologies
The project is implemented using the following technologies and libraries:
Python: Core programming language for data processing and modeling
github.com
.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for writing and running the analysis notebooks.
Pandas & NumPy: Used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Main ML library providing classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.) and preprocessing tools.
Matplotlib/Plotly: Visualization libraries for plotting data distributions and model results
github.com
.
Version Control: Git (with a .gitattributes file) is used to manage the project repository.
Learnings
Decision Trees: Understanding how a decision tree splits data into regions based on feature thresholds. They are easy to interpret but can overfit to training data
github.com
.
Random Forests: Learning that a random forest is an ensemble of many decision trees, which improves generalization and reduces overfitting. However, random forests can be computationally intensive and less interpretable than a single tree
github.com
.
Data Preprocessing: The importance of encoding categorical variables (e.g., with LabelEncoder) and scaling features, as shown in the notebookâ€™s preprocessing steps.
Training/Test Split: Recognizing the need to split data into training and test sets to fairly evaluate model performance and avoid data leakage.
Model Evaluation: Applying accuracy (and potentially other metrics) to compare models, and observing how different algorithms perform on the same dataset.
